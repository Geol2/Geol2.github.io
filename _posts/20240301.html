  <p>Since I joined a new company last September, I have spent my time adjusting.
    Although I am quite uncomfortable with meeting people and can be very shy, 
    I feel that I have met many different people and have been influenced by them, which has made me change as well.
    It seems quite important to know whether you get along with someone or not.</p>

    I've seen people around me who struggle because they don't fit in with their team, or others who work because they have no other choice and lack passion for what they do.
    In my case, I want to work, but sometimes people see me as someone who doesn't want to work.
    Why do they feel that way about me? Is it due to some kind of prejudice? I don't really know until they tell me.
    Is it because I'm slow at my tasks? They could simply ask why I'm slow or what I'm working on, but why didn't they? Or maybe it's my responsibility to approach them first and explain myself.
    Even if they ask first, I don't take it aggressively. Maybe it's uncomfortable for them, but there must be a reason.

    I started development in 2019 just because it was fun. Although my career spans 3-4 years, excluding breaks, I realize there are still so many things I don't know and areas where I'm lacking.
    But I still find development enjoyable, and I love analyzing and improving new things.
    Some may call it a "wasted career" and complain that I’m not good enough for my experience level, but everyone has their own circumstances. Just because someone has more experience doesn’t mean they can do everything well.
    Still, I think if you have more experience, you should be good at at least one thing.

    While I enjoy the projects I'm working on at my company, I also want to work on open-source projects, though I’m not sure how to start just yet.
    I like exploring various technologies, but right now, I want to focus on front-end and back-end technologies and build a strong foundation.
    What that foundation is can vary depending on who you ask.
    It's important to have fun, but I also think it’s crucial not to push myself too hard and confine myself.

    Recently, I've been using a technology called Vue, and I've been pondering how to manage state and doing some simple publishing.
    These days, technologies have become more diverse and expansive—there was a time when only knowing Spring was enough. Now, with Vue and other technologies, it can feel overwhelming. One downside is that I don't have much time to look into queries in Spring.
    It seems that my focus will mostly be on the front end, so I’m concentrating on Vue while grasping simple queries and understanding the workflow.
    I believe I'm getting better day by day.
